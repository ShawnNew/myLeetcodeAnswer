## Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock II

Say you have an array for which the ith element is the price of a given stock on day i.

Design an algorithm to find the maximum profit. You may complete as many transactions as you like (ie, buy one and sell one share of the stock multiple times). However, you may not engage in multiple transactions at the same time (ie, you must sell the stock before you buy again).

<pre><code>
class Solution {
    public int maxProfit(int[] prices) {
        int max = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i < prices.length; i++) {
            if (prices[i] > prices[i - 1]) {
                max += prices[i] - prices[i - 1];
            }
            
        
        }
        return max;
    }
}

* 因为没有限制买卖次数，可以前一天买进，后一天卖出（如果第二天价格上涨的话）。
* 最大的收益就是每次这种买卖收益的总和。
